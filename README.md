# CS230

The client for this project is The Gaming Room.

The client would like to have their game expanded to work and be used on multiple platforms. In its current state The game Draw It or Lose It only exists as an Android app. The goal would be to make it work on mobile, apple, windows, and linux applcations. As far as how the game should run is as follows.
      *The game should be able to consist of one or more teams.
      *Each team in the game should consist and have multiple players.
      *The game, team, and player IDs should all be unique so that the user can check to see if a name already exists.
      *Only one instance of the game can be active at a time.
The client just needs help getting started developing the application and developing it for different platforms as they do not know where to start.

For the Software design document I feel that I did fairly well. It could use a lot of improvement but the basics of the information I provided and the overall document I feel answers most of their questions with the execption of needing to fix certain things. 

It was found helpful to go over the basics of what the client wants the code to function like. This allows us to then begin creating code that works towards that goal.

If revisions could be made to this document it would be to better implement it, in doing this it likely mean that it would need to be further improved in the Constraints and Domain Model sections. The document should probably also end with resources/citations used to find this information, this would show the client that the information is correct and reliable.

The clients needs were seen as being that they need a application that functions and works well on all major platforms. This is implemented when we consider what language we work with and how we design the code for the applcation. This is because if we use certain languages we can make it to work on various platforms with only one language. This is always important to consider because it could change the amount of time and the overall cost it would take to hire developers to program this application.

Techniques used to solve the clients goals would be to use loops to check for used names. In the code instances are also used to create one single instance that the game exists in so that only one instance can be played and available at a time..
